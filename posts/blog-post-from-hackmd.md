# this is a heading - edited in hackmd

# does using H1 for article title mean I can't use it for writing ?

## this is a heading 2

### this is a heading 3

#### this is a heading 4

> this is a commented block

> well, I thought it would be on one line ?  I wonder if it's *possible* to make it a diferent colour ... **that** would be interesting

* Unordered List Item #1
* Unordered List Item #2
* Unordered List Item #3

here is some DAX:
```dax
Revenue ALL = 
  CALCULATE(
      [Revenue],
      ALL(Sales)
  )
```

and here is some PowerQuery, the excludes the raw stuff for jekyll:

```powerquery
let
    Source = srcFolder,
    Content = Source{2}[Content],
    #"Imported Excel" = Excel.Workbook(Content),
    rlsSalespeople_Sheet = #"Imported Excel"{[Item="rlsSalespeople",Kind="Sheet"]}[Data],
    #"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders(rlsSalespeople_Sheet, [PromoteAllScalars=true]),
    #"Lowercased Text" = Table.TransformColumns(#"Changed Type",{ {"EmployeeEmail", Text.Lower, type text}, {"ManagerEmail", Text.Lower, type text}}),
    #"Added Custom" = Table.AddColumn(#"Lowercased Text", "Salesperson Name", each [FirstName] & " "&[LastName], Text.Type)
in
    #"Added Custom"
```

this seems to work so far

what about an image ?
